# Quit Messing With My Flags
## Prompt:
![QuitMessingWithMyFlags](/images/quit_messing_with_my_flags_prompt.png)

> Sorry... the only screenshot I had of this challenge had the flag in it.

## Tools:
- [Trusty Rusty Google](https://www.google.com)
- [MD5 Conversion and Reverse Lookup](https://md5.gromweb.com/?md5=161ebd7d45089b3446ee4e0d86dbcf92) - Reverses and converts MD5 hashes to strings. 

## Solution:
The solution to this problem would be revealed after a single google for the search string of the flag: "161ebd7d45089b3446ee4e0d86dbcf92". 

1. Browsed to Google and punched in the prompt's text:
    1. ![QuitMessingWithMyFlags1](/images/quit_messing_with_my_flags_1.png)
1. The MD5 hash automatically converted to the string "P@ssw0rd"
    1. ![QuitMessingWithMyFlags2](/images/quit_messing_with_my_flags_2.png)

Flag (please don't ever use this thinking it's secure):
> flag{P@ssw0rd}
