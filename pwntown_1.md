## Prompt:

## Tools:
- [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) - This is a tool similar to Winzip. 
- pwntown_win_play.7z

## Solution:
I'm really sorry for the brevity of this explanation but I unfortunately don't quite understand how I arrived at it in the first place. I have a feeling that I potentially unlocked this flag because I ran from top to bottom, versus bottom to top (or that there was nobody else running the race at the time).

1. Download and install 7Zip if you haven't already
1. Extract and run the pwntown game
1. Walk along the wall on the far left corner of the map... from top to bottom.

1. Check the text in the chat window for the flag...
