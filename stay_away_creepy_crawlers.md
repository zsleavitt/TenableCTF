## Tools:

## Solution:
The solution to this challenge required a bit of background knowledge. I remembered from some web course long ago that the robots.txt was originally intended to keep a page from appearing in search engines. For more information on this usage check out [Google's Advanced SEO Documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/intro).

1. Navigate to the URI listed in the prompt and append /robots.txt to the end. This loads the robots.txt file, and subsequently the flag!
